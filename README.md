# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
This is a game designed in the style of the famous Flappy Bird that was so popular on the Iphone in early 2016. I have an inside joke with some friends that relates to the Sprite Cranberry advertisment staring Lebron James so i wanted to create a game for them as a holiday gift.

 My game follows the simple idea of Flappy Bird where the user only hasa single input which in this case is the spacebar. The input bounces the sprite in an attempt to avoid falling and incoming obstacles. The score increases with each successful pass. The game is an endurance game so there is no defined end.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
