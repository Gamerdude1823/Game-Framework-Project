# Overview

This is a game designed in the style of the famous Flappy Bird that was so popular on the Iphone in early 2016. I have an inside joke with some friends that relates to the Sprite Cranberry advertisment staring Lebron James so i wanted to create a game for them as a holiday gift.

 My game follows the simple idea of Flappy Bird where the user only hasa single input which in this case is the spacebar. The input bounces the sprite in an attempt to avoid falling and incoming obstacles. The score increases with each successful pass. The game is an endurance game so there is no defined end.

# Development Environment

I utilized the programming langauge Python and the extension Pygame to create this game.

# Future Work

* I want to clean up the game so it runs smoother
* Maybe add more complexity to it and optimize
* I would love to further add details like a high score or something of that nature
